# Speech-to-Text Model

Welcome to the Speech-to-Text Model project! This repository contains code and resources for training and using a speech-to-text model, with a focus on accent recognition and transcription accuracy.

## Project Overview

The Speech-to-Text Model aims to accurately transcribe spoken language into text, with an additional focus on identifying and adapting to different accents. This model can be used in various applications, such as voice assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools.

## Key Features

- **Accent Recognition**: Detects and adapts to various accents for improved transcription accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on diverse datasets to ensure high accuracy across different speakers and environments.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable for additional languages and dialects.

## Data

The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing speech samples from various speakers with different accents. The dataset includes:

- **Audio Files**: High-quality recordings of speakers from various linguistic backgrounds.
- **Transcriptions**: Accurate text transcriptions for each audio file, used as ground truth for training.
- **Accent Labels**: Metadata indicating the accent of each speaker, allowing for accent-specific adaptations.

## Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Audio files are preprocessed to normalize volume, remove noise, and segment into manageable clips.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features such as MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) from the audio data.
3. **Model Training**: Utilizes a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN) to learn the mapping from audio features to text transcriptions.
4. **Accent Adaptation**: Incorporates accent labels into the training process to improve recognition accuracy for various accents.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Accent Identification Accuracy.

## Usage

The model can be used for both online and offline transcription tasks. It provides an API for integration into other applications, and a command-line interface for standalone use.
